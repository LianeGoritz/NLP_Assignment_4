Using the Movie Review corpus, write a program that classify reviews according to their positive/negative polarity, and evaluate the results of your program. You should use Word2Vec to represent the words, and the Multi-layer neural network classifier (about 10 hidden layers with 5 units each). You should split the data into training and testing (e.g., 90\% and 10\%).
